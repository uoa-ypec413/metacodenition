abstract = {Phenomenographic studies in computing education research have previously focused on learning "programming thinking" [3], the act of learning to program [2], and conceptions of learning generally in an engineering context [10]. In the present study we analyze and discuss "what it takes to do computer programming" using phenomenography as research approach. This study is based on a large survey dataset gathered in summer outreach courses for K-12 students. The analysis resulted in 12 qualitatively different categories belonging to five separate, emergent themes: Syntax and language features, nature of programming work generally, computational thinking and problem solving, prerequisites, and auxiliary skills. We additionally reviewed whether the students' previous experience explains the categories, and observed that a mechanistic view of programming was prevailing among the inexperienced users, while experienced students more often stressed algorithmic thinking and logical reasoning.This study resembles work done by Eckerdal et al. [3], but gives a K-12 perspective to the question, "what does it takes to do programming?"},

abstract = {Graduating computer science and software engineering students do not always possess the necessary skills, abilities, or knowledge when beginning their careers in the software industry. The lack of these skills and abilities can limit the productivity of newly hired, recent graduates, or even prevent them from gaining employment. This paper presents the results of an empirical study where twenty-three managers and hiring personnel from various software companies in the United States and Europe were interviewed. Participants were asked about areas where recent graduates frequently struggled when beginning employment at their companies and which skill deficiencies might prevent a recent graduate from being hired. The results of this study indicate that recent graduates struggle with using configuration management systems (and other software tools), effectively communicating with co-workers and customers, producing unit tests for their code, and other skills or abilities. The results also indicate that a lack of project experience and problem solving abilities are the most commonly cited issues preventing students from gaining employment. This research is intended to assist educators in identifying areas where students may not measure up the expectations of industry companies and in improving the curriculum at their universities to better prepare them for their future careers.},

In this paper we contribute a framework for reasoning about self-regulation in programming problem solving. We then use this framework to investigate how 37 novice programmers of varying experience used self-regulation during a sequence of programming problems. We analyzed the extent to which novices engaged in five kinds of self-regulation during their problem solving, how this self-regulation varied between students enrolled in CS1 and CS2, and how self-regulation played a role in structuring problem solving. We then investigated the relationship between self-regulation and programming errors. Our results indicate that while most novices engage in self-regulation to navigate and inform their problem solving efforts, these self-regulation efforts are only effective when accompanied by programming knowledge adequate to succeed at solving a given problem, and only some types of self-regulation appeared related to errors. We discuss the implications of these findings on problem solving pedagogy in computing education.},

This approach not only gives students a way to solve problems, but also ideas for what to do if they get stuck during the process. Furthermore, it provides a way for instructors to work examples in class that focus on the process of devising the code - instructors can show how to come up with the code, rather than just showing an example. We describe our experience with this technique in several introductory programming courses - both in the classroom and online.},

abstract = {When solving programming problems, novices are often not aware of where they are in the problem-solving process. For instance, students who misinterpret the problem prompt will most likely not form a valid conceptual model of the task and fail to make progress towards a working solution. Avoiding such errors, and recovering from them once they occur, requires metacognitive skills that enable students to reflect on their problem-solving processes. For these reasons, developing metacognitive awareness is crucially important for novice students. Previous research has shown that explicitly teaching key steps of programming problem-solving, and having students reflect on where they are in the problem-solving process, can help students complete future programming assignments. Such metacognitive awareness training can be done through personal tutoring, but can be difficult to implement without a high ratio of instructors to students. We explore a more scalable approach, making use of an automated assessment tool, and conduct a controlled experiment to see whether scaffolding the problem-solving process would increase metacognitive awareness and improve student performance. We collected all code submissions by students in both control and experimental groups, as well as data from direct observation using a think-aloud protocol. We found that students who received the intervention showed a higher degree of understanding of the problem prompt and were more likely to complete the programming task successfully.},

abstract = {Prior research has shown that novices face metacognitive difficulties associated with understanding problem statements. Metacognition refers to the processes that an individual uses to plan, monitor, and assess their own understanding and performance and is often described as "thinking about thinking." Metacognitive awareness is a higher-order thinking skill that includes knowing when and how to use particular strategies for problem-solving. However, novice students often lack metacognitive skills. This can be a disadvantage, particularly when learning in unfamiliar domains. For instance, students who misinterpret a problem statement will most likely form an invalid mental model of the problem which they may find difficult to correct. A prior think-aloud study that used an intervention focused on this initial step in the problem-solving process showed promising results at a small scale. In this paper, we report on a large (n = 976) controlled experiment to examine the scalability of the aforementioned study. We measure the effect on novice programmer performance of metacognitive scaffolding that requires deliberate reflection on the problem statement before any code is written. Although control and experimental groups exhibited similar completion rates overall, students in the experimental group encountered significantly fewer errors that related to the formation of an incorrect mental model of the problem. These results hold promise in moving towards more reliable methods for developing metacognitive awareness in novice programmers.},

abstract = {The first step in writing code is understanding the problem to be solved. When this step is not properly completed, students can waste time developing a solution to the wrong problem. Arguably, this tendency is exacerbated by online automatically-tested code submission systems where students work in isolation and sometimes appear to focus more on passing the instructor testcases than on understanding the problem or its solution. We report on an randomized A/B test with 831 CS1 students using an online submission system. Students in the control group wrote small Python functions based on a written description including a docstring with one example. Before the treatment-group students solved the same exercise, they were given a description of the same functions and were asked to provide the corresponding output for three sets of input. We hypothesized that this would decrease the time and attempts required to correctly write the code because students in the treatment group would not waste time on an incorrectly-conceived problem. We found support for this hypothesis on one of the problems but not on the other, and we offer some suggestions as to how this might be explained.},

abstract = {Coercing new programmers to adopt disciplined development practices such as thorough unit testing is a challenging endeavor. Test-driven development (TDD) has been proposed as a solution to improve both software design and testing. Test-driven learning (TDL) has been proposed as a pedagogical approach for teaching TDD without imposing significant additional instruction time.This research evaluates the effects of students using a test-first (TDD) versus test-last approach in early programming courses, and considers the use of TDL on a limited basis in CS1 and CS2. Software testing, programmer productivity, programmer performance, and programmer opinions are compared between test-first and test-last programming groups. Results from this research indicate that a test-first approach can increase student testing and programmer performance, but that early programmers are very reluctant to adopt a test-first approach, even after having positive experiences using TDD. Further, this research demonstrates that TDL can be applied in CS1/2, but suggests that a more pervasive implementation of TDL may be necessary to motivate and establish disciplined testing practice among early programmers.},

abstract = {Learning to recognize and apply programming patterns — reusable abstractions of code — is critical to becoming a proficient computer scientist. However, many introductory Computer Science courses do not teach patterns, in part because teaching these concepts requires significant curriculum changes. As an alternative, we explore how a novel user interface for practicing coding — Faded Parsons Problems — can support introductory Computer Science students in learning to apply programming patterns. We ran a classroom-based study with 237 students which found that Faded Parsons Problems, or rearranging and completing partially blank lines of code into a valid program, are an effective exercise interface for teaching programming patterns, significantly surpassing the performance of the more standard approaches of code writing and code tracing exercises. Faded Parsons Problems also improve overall code writing ability at a comparable level to code writing exercises, but are preferred by students.},

abstract = {The difficulty in understanding compiler error messages can be a major impediment to novice student learning. To alleviate this issue, multiple researchers have run experiments enhancing compiler error messages in automated assessment tools for programming assignments. The conclusions reached by these published experiments appear to be conducting. We examine these experiments and propose five potential reasons for the inconsistent conclusions concerning enhanced compiler error messages: (1) students do not read them, (2) researchers are measuring the wrong thing, (3) the effects are hard to measure, (4) the messages are not properly designed, (5) the messages are properly designed, but students do not understand them in context due to increased cognitive load. We constructed mixed-methods experiments designed to address reasons 1 and 5 with a specific automated assessment tool, Athene, that previously reported inconclusive results. Testing student comprehension of the enhanced compiler error messages outside the context of an automated assessment tool demonstrated their effectiveness over standard compiler error messages. Quantitative results from a 60 minute one-on-one think-aloud study with 31 students did not show substantial increase in student learning outcomes over the control. However, qualitative results from the one-on-one think-aloud study indicated that most students are reading the enhanced compiler error messages and generally make effective changes after encountering them.},

abstract = {Various tools and approaches are available to support undergraduate students learning to program. Most of them concentrate on the code and aim to ease the visualization of data structures or guide the debugging. However, in undergraduate introductory courses, students are typically given exercises in the form of a natural language problem. Deriving a correct solution largely depends on the problem-solving strategy they adopt rather than on their proficiency in dealing with the syntax and semantics of the code. Indeed, they face various challenges (apart from the coding), such as identifying the relevant information, stating the algorithmic steps to solve it, breaking it into smaller parts, and evaluating the implemented solution. To our knowledge, almost no attention has been paid to supporting such problem-solving strategies before and during the coding. This paper reports an interview and a sketching exercise with 10 participants exploring how the novices approach the programming exercises from a problem-solving perspective and how they imagine a tool to support their cognitive process. Findings show that students intuitively perform various actions over the exercise text, and they would appreciate having support from the development environment. Accordingly, based on these findings, we provide implications for designing tools to support problem-solving strategies.},
